# ClockWERX Event Clock Timer

## Overview

This project creates a React App utilized on the client side to communicate and run timer functions for multiple event clocks stationed in different conference rooms.


## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js installed on your environement.
And please use the appropriate [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your Editor (not mandatory).

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v0.10.24

    $ npm --version
    1.3.21

#### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Please install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if it's not already done with the following command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

If everything when fine, you should run

    brew install node

#### Node installation on Linux

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

#### Node installation on Windows

Just go on [official Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) & grab the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it.

## Install

You should have already installed node.js on your machine and [cloned the repo](https://github.com/sofwerx/Clockwerx.git) however if you haven't please visit GitHub and proceed through the following instructions.

    $ git clone https://github.com/sofwerx/Clockwerx.git
    $ cd Clockwerx/src/EventClock_FE
    $ npm i

### Configure app

    This section needs an update

Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` then edit it with the url where you have setup:

- backend api
- oauth like endpoint for auth
- development

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Update sources

Some packages usages might change so you should run `npm prune` & `npm install` often.
A common way to update is by doing

    $ git pull
    $ npm prune
    $ npm i

To run those 3 commands you can just do

    $ npm run pull

**Note:** Unix user can just link the `git-hooks/post-merge`:

## Enable git hooks (unix only :/)

    $ npm run create-hook-symlinks

### `post-merge` (≃ `npm install`)

This hook will `npm prune && npm install` each time you `git pull` something if the `package.json` has been modified.

## Languages & tools

### React

This project is created as a React App and all html is templated through the different react components and `js` files.

- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) is used for UI.

### JavaScript

- [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/docs/) is used to prevent JavaScript error.
- [JSCS](https://npmjs.org/package/jscs) is used to check coding conventions.
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to handle allow us to write our client-side scripts with [es6 syntax](http://es6.github.io/) thanks to [es6ify](https://github.com/thlorenz/es6ify).


### SCSS

- [sass/node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) is used to write futureproof CSS for CSS vendor prefix under the hood).

_Autoprefixer_ is included and use [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/) database to avoid outdated prefixes. _You can forget CSS prefixes NOW._

### Static server with Livereload

The app embed for development a static connect server with livereload plugged.
So each time you start the app, you get automatic refresh in the browser whenever you update a file.
